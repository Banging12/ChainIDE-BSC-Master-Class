## Week 4

### How solidity works in a smart contract?

##### 1. Make an introduction of smart contracts and talk about the internal connection with block chain.
##### 2. Introduce the smart contract programming language ----- solidity. (i.e. Solidity Grammar/ function/ .sol file structure/ memory storage)
##### This folder consists on the solutions of the tasks given in the week 4. 
###### Mapping, structure, and modifier have been used in these contracts. You can copy these codes and compile using [BSCIDE](https://bscide.com/project/welcome), and deploy it on BSC. This all material is provided for the practice purpose. The other reading material regarding these smart contracts and solidity grammar can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/120QjDd5UGNb9IYZ0iSC3MjXDkq4ajy78kER3PTGnlWY/edit?usp=sharing).
