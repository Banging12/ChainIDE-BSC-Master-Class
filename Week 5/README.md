# Week5
**This week is about how to create an ERC20/BEP20 token and use it to create a farming system.**

After you deployed the ERC20/BEP20 token, you should write it down. When you create the farming contract, you should paste them to the corresponding parameters.

You can learn these codes and make some improvements on top of it.
